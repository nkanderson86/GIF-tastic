# GIF-tastic

Description: 
First time playing around with an API.  Used javascript and jQuery to set up an AJAX call to retreive GIFs and display them on the page after a button is clicked.   The page is populated with a handful of animals that are hard coded into an array which is then looped through to dynamically create buttons.  The user can input anything into the form on the page to create a new button for the topic of thier choosing. 

Wins: 
- Got my AJAX call working with template literals.
- Happy with the styling and fonts used on my page 
- GIFs start and stop animation on click 

Pain Points: 
- I could not, for the life of me, figure out how to clear the input form after the user clicked submit or hit enter.  I tried everything I coudl think of and google'd around for at least an hour before giving up.  
- Additionally, I wanted to add some logic to prevent the user from submitting the same input twice and creating duplicate buttons.  Things got a little messy and so I decided to stick with my working code for now. 

Nice to haves:
- If I had more time I'd address the two issues mentioned above in pain points
- I'd also like to figure out how to create a card for each GIF and display the Rating, and some more information, in the card.  Aesthetically that would look way better then what I currently have.
